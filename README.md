EOS                -- the chiral EFT EOSs used for our study
POSSIS_lightcurves -- EM lightcurves that used as input for gwemlightcurves 
bilby_patches      -- all necessary code changes to redo our analysis with parallel_bilby
posterior_samples  -- all posterior samples from our individual analysis steps
